        "A pop up store is where a brand opens a store in a certain area  for a short period of time. The likes of Nike, BarkShop and many more have had great success with pop up stores. Pop up stores can lead to massive social media exposure and rapid sales as people have a fear of missing out since they know the store will be gone at any moment.\n",

        "The executives must ideally pick the best location as 2020 was a difficult year for retail, and they need to have a successful 2021 in order for the company to continue surviving. \n"
